public enum ShipDirection {
    /*A simple enumeration class (enum) to represent the direction of the ship
It has two values, HORIZONTAL and VERTICAL, and a helper method:
  fromString(String dirString)
This static method is used when reading the player’s input for the direction of a ship: it ac- cepts a String corresponding to the desired orientation (e.g. “h” for horizontal and “v” for vertical, but you may choose other strings as you wish) and returns the corresponding ob- ject of ShipDirection. The method throws an InputMismatchException if the string is unknown.1
